## Download MSVC build tools and the Windows SDK for Rust development on GNU/Linux

This script downloads and extracts the needed components of the Visual Studio 2017 build tools and the Windows SDK,
so that Rust toolchains can target the platform.

Note that these are the very latest build tools and the latest SDK. If you are okay with the older 2015 build tools,
you should download the [enterprise WDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/license-terms-enterprise-wdk-1703) instead,
it contains all the needed files.

Requirements:

* 7z executable
* GNU/Linux with GNU Bash installed. May also work on Mac or other BSD's, but I haven't tried.
* Wine 2.21 or later. You really need 2.21: Wine 2.20 or older won't work. Compilation is explained below.
* [msitools](https://wiki.gnome.org/msitools) version 0.98 or higher. Older versions don't support the SDK MSIs.

The bleeding edge Wine is required to run the linker. Msitools is required to
extract the SDK MSIs.

Compilation of any C/C++ dependencies is not supported.

## Compiling Wine 2.21

If your distribution has already Wine 2.21 or any later version, you can skip this step and install Wine 2.21 via your distribution instead.
However, if you are on no rolling-release distribution, Wine 2.21 may not have reached you yet.
I'm explaining below how to compile it, so that you don't have to figure it out yourself.

First, obtain the dev-dependencies of wine (assuming Ubuntu here, but other Debian like distros may work as well).

```bash
sudo apt build-dep wine64-development
```

Then, obtain the wine source code:

```bash
git clone git://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git
cd wine
git checkout wine-2.21
```

Now create a build directory, and execute the build:

```bash
mkdir /path/to/wine-2.21-build
cd /path/to/wine-2.21-build
/path/to/wine/source/configure --prefix=/path/to/wine-2.21-build --enable-win64
make -j 8
```

Now, if things went well, you should have a binary `wine` inside that build directory. That's the executable you need to point the `WINE_EXEC` environment variable at when running the linker.

## Setup

First, execute `get.sh`, and accept the licensing terms.
If you have accepted, `get.sh` will download files to the `dl/` folder and extract them into the `extracted/` folder.

Then put the following into your `~/.cargo/config`:

```toml
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
linker = "/path/to/msvc-wine-rust/linker-scripts/linkx64.sh"

[target.i686-pc-windows-msvc]
linker = "/path/to/msvc-wine-rust/linker-scripts/linkx32.sh"
```

Then go to your favourite Rust project and compile it e.g. with:

```
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

As the wine executable might not be in your `$PATH`, you can also override it manually:

```
WINE_EXEC=/path/to/wine cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Same applies for `get.sh` as well -- if the Wine installation with 32 bit and .Net support is not in your `$PATH`,
you can invoke `WINE_EXEC=/path/to/wine/with/dotnet ./get.sh`.
